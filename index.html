							<h2>About Jurassic Park</h2>
							<p>Jurassic Park is a science fiction-adventure-drama film directed by Steven Spielberg, based upon the novel of the same name, written by Michael Crichton. The story involves scientists visiting a safari amusement park of genetically engineered dinosaurs on an island over one weekend. Sabotage sets the carnivorous dinosaurs on the loose, and the technicians and visitors attempt to escape the island.</p>

						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Brontosaurus</h2>
							<p>Brontosaurus had a long, thin neck and a small head adapted for a herbivorous lifestyle; a bulky, heavy torso; and a long, whip-like tail. The various species lived during the Late Jurassic epoch in the Morrison Formation of what is now North America, and were extinct by the end of the Jurassic. Adult individuals of Brontosaurus are estimated to have weighed up to 33070 pounds and measured up to 72 feet long.</p>

						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Triceratops</h2>
							<p>Triceratops was a very common dinosaur which lived at the very end of the Cretaceous period. It had a huge frilled head with horns over each eye that could reach over 3 feet long. Triceratops had a third, smaller horn on its nose. These would be fearsome weapons against a predator.</p>

						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Velociraptor</h2>
							<p>Velociraptors were instinctive hunters and never passed up prey. They killed even when they weren't hungry. They killed just for the pleasure of killing. They were agile, tireless runners and incredible jumpers. They had lethal weapons on each of their four limbs; a strong punch with one of the forearms could lacerate a man. And had powerful jaws that ripped meat instead of biting it. They were also a lot more intelligent than other dinosaurs and seemed to be natural cage-breakers. They also had forked tongues.</p>

					<div class="slide-dino six" id="allosaurus">
						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Allosaurus</h2>
							<p>As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus was at the top of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses.</p>

					<div class="slide-dino seven" id="baryonyx">
						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Baryonyx</h2>
							<p>The mouth shape of this dinosaur was very similar to that of a crocodile, and it had a large claw, about 31cm long, probably on its thumb. Baryonyx may have crouched on river banks or waded into shallow water to hook fish with its claws. It was also a scavenger.</p>

						<div class="dino-info">
							<h2>Tyrannosaurus</h2>
							<p>Tyrannosaurus rex is arguably the most famous dinosaur of them all. Tyrannosaurus was the last and largest of the Tyrannosaurs. Commonly known as "T. rex", this species lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in modern day North America and was therefore among one of the last non-avian dinosaurs. In popular culture, Tyrannosaurus has an iconic status shared by few other species.</p>
